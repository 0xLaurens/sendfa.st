# Sendfa.st
Sendfa.st 💫 is a peer-to-peer file sharing service that enables users to share files quickly and securely. 
The files that are shared directly transferred from one device to another without any intermediate server. The application is built using [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) and [Websockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/API/WebSocket).

## Features
- No file size limit ♾️ 
- No registration required 🤖
- End-to-end encryption 🔒
- Cross-platform support 🤝
- Fast file transfer 🚀
- Free to use 💸
- Open-source 📂

## How it works
1. Users connect to the same room by sharing the room ID.
2. The users are connected to each other using WebRTC.
3. The sender selects the file to share and the receiver accepts the file.
4. The file is transferred directly from the sender to the receiver.
